};

ReplayKitBridge.Instance.onStopRecordingCallback = () => {
    // Called when recording has been stopped.
    Time.timeScale = 0;                     // Pause scene while user is editting and sharing recorded screen.

};

ReplayKitBridge.Instance.onFinishPreviewCallback = (string activityType) => {
    // Called when recorded video has been saved or when the done button has been pressed.
    ReplayKitBridge.DismissPreviewView();   // Dismiss preview view.
    Time.timeScale = 1;                     // Resume time scale.
};

ReplayKitBridge.Instance.onCancelRecordingCallback = () => {
    // Called when recording has been stopped and discarded.
};

ReplayKitBridge.Instance.onStopRecordingWithErrorCallback = (string error) => {
